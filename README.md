Usage:
This is the source code so there shouldn't be any skepticism                                                                                                             

You will need to install colorama, requests and possibly ctypes.

Windows, Linux, Mac Open cmd/shell/terminal and type the following pip install colorama, pip install requests, pip install ctypes

If that doesn't work try:
typing the following: python3 -m pip install colorama, python3 -m pip install requests, python3 -m pip install ctypes

Credits: Almost everything was made by me except token bruteforce (Social404) and token checker (GuFFy_OwO).

Have fun, and remember that almost all nitro and tokens won't work but you can still try them.
