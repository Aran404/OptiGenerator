Usage:
This is the source code so there shouldn't be any skepticism                                                                                                             

You can just run the batch file attached name PackageInstaller.bat, but if that doesn't work try these
You will need to install colorama, requests.

Windows, Linux, Mac Open cmd/shell/terminal and type the following pip install colorama and pip install requests

If that doesn't work try:
typing the following: python3 -m pip install colorama and python3 -m pip install requests

Credits: Almost everything was made by me except token bruteforce (Social404) and token checker (GuFFy_OwO).

Have fun, and remember that almost all nitro and tokens won't work but you can still try them.
PS. For the token checker the indivual file checker is broken so make a new folder and put your tokens in there, then use option 2 for multiple files.
